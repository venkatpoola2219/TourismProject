                            Kanniyakumari is a special destination in many different ways. It is the southernmost tip of the mainland of India. Three major water bodies – the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean – converge right here in Kanniyakumari. Such a geographically blessed destination is rare and these features make Kanniyakumari  one of the most visited places in India annually. 

                            The place gets its name from the Hindu goddess Devi Kanniyakumari, who is considered to be the sister of Lord Krishna. When the Dutch East India Company conquered Portuguese Ceylon from the Portuguese East Indies, the name Kanniyakumari was shortened to Comorin. Eventually during the British regime in India, the destination began to be called Cape Comorin. Later, the Government of India renamed it as Kanniyakumari.

                                    The legend behind the temple is associated with Lord Rama from the Indian epic Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama, after defeating the demon king Ravana, wanted to worship Lord Shiva as part of atonement. He asks Hanuman to bring him a Linga from Kashi. When Hanuman delayed his return, Goddess Sita made a Shivalinga using sand so that Rama could offer his prayers. It is believed that the self-same Shiva Linga, known as Ramalingam, is now worshipped at the Ramanathaswamy temple. The lingam brought by Hanuman from Kailash is called VishwalingaThere are 22 Theerthams (holy water bodies) inside the temple where devotees bathe to atone for their sins.
