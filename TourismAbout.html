                <h2>Benefits of Tourism</h2>
                <p>
                    The Tourism industry gives a wide scope of employment to people. It has not only provided employment opportunities to people but also alleviated poverty and sustained human development. Tourism has promoted and benefitted small and local handicrafts and cultural activities. It has played a significant role in promoting national integrity and international understanding. The most important benefit of Tourism is to give a sense of relief and relaxation to people when they get tired and exhausted from their hectic schedules and hustle-bustle of city life. It is a pleasant gateway for people. The Tourism industry has also benefited other sectors like aviation, transport, horticulture, and handicraft. The hotel industry has immensely benefited from Tourism and provides ample employment and help in earning foreign exchange. This industry has become one of the major contributors to the GDP of the country. It has significantly contributed to the economic development of India by improving transportation and infrastructure facilities across the country.
                    Tourism has played a very vital role in reviving India’s art and culture. Tourists from foreign countries show a keen interest in the rich culture and heritage of India and this boosts the morale of the small artisans and adds to their novelty.

                <h2>Promotion and Development of Tourism</h2>
                <p>
                    For better growth, the Indian Government is taking a keen interest in promoting the different sections of Tourism such as rural Tourism, eco-Tourism, and spiritual Tourism, spa Tourism, and adventure Tourism. Nowadays, medical Tourism has also become an important source of revenue for the healthcare sector. Many people from our neighboring countries and from our western countries are turning towards India for affordable and world-class health care services and treatment.
                    Indian Tourism has grown significantly over the years. The services rendered to the tourists visiting India from foreign countries are the indiscernible products of the Tourism industry.  These products like hospitality services of all kinds for tourists turn into invisible exports because these services generate a lot of earnings without leaving Indian soil. The Tourism Ministry of India has played a major role in the development of the industry. The India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) formed by the Tourism department has carried out many vital developments to encourage Tourism in India. The ITDC hotels are situated at the prime locations of important tourist destinations in India and provide comfortable and affordable boarding and lodging.
                    The launching of the ‘Incredible India’ campaign by the Government of India is instrumental in promoting India as a holistic tourist destination in the domestic and international markets. Other specialized international media campaigns under ‘Incredible India’ have been launched and even the celebrities of our country have been roped into making this campaign of ‘Incredible India’ a big success in foreign lands also.
                    The ‘Clean India’ campaign launched by the Indian Government ensures full cleanliness, which has become an indispensable norm at all the tourist destinations. The Government has also conducted regular studies to analyze the market in order to identify the key factors, income figures, holiday habits, and psychology of people. This helps them to identify the key drivers in the Tourism industry and tackle the issues that deter the scope of Tourism.
                    According to research reports, the medical Tourism market in the Indian healthcare sector is valued to be worth over three hundred million dollars with more than one lakh foreign patients coming every year. The Government has also gone a step further to permit foreigners to visit India on an e-Tourist Visa for attending short-term yoga programs.
