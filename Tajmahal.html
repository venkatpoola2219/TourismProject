                <P>
                    The Taj Mahal in Agra is a monumental tribute to undying love, and it is located on the banks of the Yamuna River. Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of this mausoleum in the early 17th century for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. It is also a brilliant representation of the pinnacle of Mughal architecture and grandeur. Due to the stunning nature of its architecture, it is considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Contemporary World    
                </P>
                <h4>HISTORY TAJ MAHAL</h4>
                <p>
                    Shah Jahan, the Emperor of the Mughal Empire, had his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, commissioned the construction of the Taj Mahal, the grandest mausoleum the world had ever seen at the time. On the banks of the Yamuna River, construction of the mausoleum began in 1632, approximately one year after Mumtaz passed away; it was built in her honour. Even though the construction of the primary mausoleum began as early as 1643, the entire complex was not finished being built until 1653. Unfortunately, in the year 1658, the emperor was deposed from his position as ruler and placed in prison by his son Aurangzeb. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for his final days in the nearby Agra Fort, from which he had a view of his marvellous creation. He was able to see it before he died. When he passed away in 1666, he was laid to rest within the Taj Mahal, right next to the tomb of his beloved wife.
                    During their conquest of Agra in the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur laid siege to the Taj Mahal and pillaged its interior. During the Revolution of 1857, British soldiers and officials caused damage to this memorial by removing precious stones from its walls and are responsible for the majority of the damage that was sustained.
                    During the early part of the 20th century, the Taj Mahal was the subject of extensive restoration efforts. These efforts were directed by Lord Curzon, who served as Viceroy of India at the time. After India gained its independence, the monument was brought under the protection of the Indian government.
                </p>
                <h4>ARCHITECTURE OF TAJ MAHAL</h4>
                <p>
                    The Taj Mahal is regarded as one of the greatest architectural achievements in human history. Its design is a synthesis of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural traditions. The crenellated walls on three sides and the Yamuna on the fourth side separate the monument’s 42-acre grounds from the rest of the surrounding land. It was built out of white Makrana marble that was sourced from the Indian state of Rajasthan. To further enhance the beauty of the memorial, thousands of precious and semi-precious gemstones were also incorporated into its design.
                    The Taj Mahal is perched atop an elevated square plinth that features four minarets standing at each of the four corners of the structure. The crypts are housed in a symmetrical building with a dome that is enormous and a finial on top. The entrance to the building is in the shape of an arch. There are replicas of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal’s sarcophagi located in the main hall of the mausoleum. The actual tombs can be found within a chamber that is locked and located on a lower level.
                    Even though the exterior decorations of the monument are a testament to the Mughal craftsmanship, the interiors of the building are just as magnificent. In the inner chamber, which is in the shape of an octagon, there is jali bordering and quotations from the Quran engraved on the cenotaphs. Additionally, there are intricate decorative details that include twining vines, flowers, and fruits, which are highlighted with 28 different kinds of precious and semiprecious stones. In accordance with the customs of Islam, the crypts that hold the primary bodies are relatively unadorned, despite the fact that the base and the casket themselves feature intricate designs
                </p>
                <h4>TAJ MAHAL GARDEN</h4>
                <p>
                    The Taj Mahal is encircled by a vast Mughal garden known as a Charbagh, which spans approximately 980 square feet. The garden is separated into sixteen different sunken flowerbeds by raised pathways. The beauty of the entire location is enhanced by the presence of an elevated marble water tank that is located between the main gate and the tomb. The famous Persian gardens served as the inspiration for the original design of the Taj Gardens. However, when the colonial rulers took possession of the Taj, they altered the landscape of the garden so that it resembled the lawns in London. This gave the garden the appearance of being in London.
                </p>
                <h4>TAJ MAHAL OVER THE YEARS</h4>
                <p>
                    Under Aurangzeb’s long rule (1658-1707), the Mughal empire reached the height of its strength. However, his militant Muslim policies, including the destruction of many Hindu temples and shrines, undermined the enduring strength of the empire and led to its demise by the mid-18th century.
                    Even as Mughal power crumbled, the Taj Mahal suffered from neglect and disrepair in the two centuries after Shah Jahan’s death. Near the turn of the 19th century, Lord Curzon, then British viceroy of India, ordered a major restoration of the mausoleum complex as part of a colonial effort to preserve India’s artistic and cultural heritag Today, some 3 million people a year (or around 45,000 a day during peak tourist season) visit the Taj Mahal.
                    Air pollution from nearby factories and automobiles poses a continual threat to the mausoleum’s gleaming white marble façade, and in 1998, India’s Supreme Court ordered a number of anti-pollution measures to protect the building from deterioration. Some factories were closed, while vehicular traffic was banned from the immediate vicinity of the complex.
                </p>
                <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
                <P>
                    The Taj Mahal is a monumental monument that was built in Agra as a tribute to love that lasts forever. It is situated on the banks of the Yamuna River. In the early 17th century, Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan gave the order for his wife Mumtaz Mahal’s mausoleum to be built, and he oversaw its construction. It is generally agreed upon that the Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful structures in the entire world. In addition to this, it is an outstanding illustration of the height of Mughal architectural design and splendour. It is regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World due to the breathtaking nature of its architecture, and therefore it is one of the wonders on this list.
