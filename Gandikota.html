                <p>
                    The history of tourism in Gandikota is relatively new. Unlike the Grand Canyon, which has been a travelerâ€™s destination for over a century, Gandikota has only started gaining widespread popularity in the last couple of decades. With the growing interest in offbeat and adventure tourism in India, Gandikota with its impressive landscape and historic ruins has caught the attention of both domestic and international tourists.
                    The fort at Gandikota was built in the 13th century and has been under the rule of various dynasties, including the Chalukyas, the Qutub Shahis, and the Vijayanagara Empire. It's the historical significance coupled with the remarkable natural beauty that has made Gandikota a place of interest for those who seek to explore the road less traveled.
                </p>
                <h5>THE GRAND CANYON OF INDIA </h5>
                <p>
                    Located in the Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh, India, Gandikota is a small village that's come into prominence for its breathtaking gorge formed by the Penna River. The name 'Gandikota' translates to 'Gorge Fort,' reflecting its historical significance and the mesmerizing natural beauty that surrounds it. Often referred to as the 'Grand Canyon of India', it doesn't rival the actual Grand Canyon in size but it offers similarly spectacular views.
                </p>
                <h5>BEST TIME TO VISIT GANDIKOTA</h5>
                <P>
                    The ideal time to visit Gandikota, often referred to as the Grand Canyon of India, is during the cooler months of October to March. During this period, the weather is pleasantly mild, with temperatures ranging from a minimum of 15Â°C to a maximum of 30Â°C. This favorable climate allows travelers to comfortably explore the majestic Gandikota Fort and the stunning gorge created by the Pennar River without the intense heat that is common in this region for the rest of the year.
                    Visitors should especially consider planning their trip around November when the weather is relatively cool, and the natural beauty of the region is at its peak post-monsoon season. It is also a great time for activities such as trekking, rock climbing, and camping. However, if you're interested in local events or festivals, it is recommended to check the local calendar as the region occasionally hosts cultural and traditional festivals that can provide a deeper insight into the area's heritage and add value to your travel experience.
                </P>

                <h5>ABOUT GANDIKOTA</h5>
                <p>
                    Gandikota is a village and historical fort on the right bank of the Penna river, 15 km from Jammalamadugu in Kadapa district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The fort was the centre of power for various dynasties, such as the Kalyani Chalukyas, Pemmasani Nayakas, and the Golconda Sultanate. Gandikota was the capital of Pemmasani Nayakas for more than 300 years. Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayudu constructed the huge fort at Gandikota with 101 towers replacing the previous sand fort constructed by Kaka Raja, Vassals of Kalyani Chalukya rulers. Various additions of Islamic architecture were made during subsequent Muslim rule.
                </p>
                <h5>ARCHITECTURE OF GANDIKOTA FORT</h5>
                <P>
                    At present, Gandikota Fort lies in ruins. The monument includes a temple, a large granary and a mosque. There are two adjoining towers in the Jamia Masjid. The granary is large and has a vaulted roof. There are 2 ancient Hindu temples in the vicinity of the fort. These temples are devoted to Raghunatha Swami and Madhava Swami.

                </P>
                <h5>PENNA RIVER VIEW POINT</h5>
                <P>
                    The viewpoint offers breathtaking panoramic views of the Penna river gorge flowing between the cliffs of Erramala hills, with a width of around 200 metres, forming one of the finest gorges in South India. It offers mesmerizing views of sunrise and sunset and presents a blend of natural beauty and architectural marvel. The terrain is made up of sedimentary rocks called Gandikota quartzite.
                </P>
                <h5>JAMA MASJID</h5>
                <P>
                    To the north of Madhavaraya Temple lies the imposing Jama Masjid constructed by Mir Jumla who occupied the fort in 1650. The Jama Masjid, has two circular buttresses at the corners of the facade, which extend into minarets, culminating in domical finials. It stands in a spacious quadrangle, possibly used as a caravanserai. The facade features triple arches, and a decorated parapet with arched openings. Inside, sixty-four rooms line the mosque wall, with additional thirty-two rooms outside, likely serving as stables. A (now dysfunctional) water fountain lies at the centre of an expansive open area directly before the mosque.
                    The mosque displays distinctive elements of Islamic architecture. Its ceiling is vaulted, upheld by two ribbed, pointed arches. Each vault’s interior is adorned with geometric patterns , forming a circle at the top. The soft, diffused light illuminates the vaults, further enhancing the ceiling’s beauty. The mosque’s two minarets are masterpieces in their own right, embellished with lotus petal capitals, arched circular galleries, geometric patterns, and topped with onion domes.
                </P>
                <h5>THE MADHAVARAYA TEMPLE</h5>
                <P>
                    The Madhavaraya Temple is distinguished by its four-storeyed entrance tower — the gopura. The gopura measures 16.20 m X 10.72 m at its base. The tower displays intricate carvings of deities and detailed pilasters on its four-storeyed, steeply pyramidal structure. It features detailed mouldings and densely arrayed wall pilasters. Towards the interior of the gopura, double chambers flank the passageway, with columns featuring figural carvings, including Shalabhanjika on both sides. Besides the gopura, there are narrow entrances on all other three sides. The sikhara of the gopura has fallen.
                    The temple faces east and is surrounded by prakara, a pillared hall extending on all sides, and forms a rectangular courtyard. The main temple is situated amidst the courtyard and stands on a raised platform called Adhishthana. On the projections of the Adhishthana, the temple features carvings of various deities, including Venugopala, Surya, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Ganapati, and Yoga Narasimha. The plan of the temple consists of a series of pillared halls called Ardhamandapam, Mahamandapam, and Mukhamandapam followed by Antaralaya and Garbhgriha. The Ardhamandapam is the extension of Maha Mandapa towards the east, having a width of 2.44 m and length of 10.15 m, supported by four ornate pillars, each adorned with intricate carving. The Mahamandapam consists of thirty-six pillars, out of which sixteen pillars are at the inner layer, while twenty stand on the outer edge of the platform. The Mahamandapam, measuring 18.29 m east-west and 13.72 m south-north, features a central rectangular court situated at a lower elevation, creating a semblance of a shallow pit, surrounded by a raised platform on all sides. Access to the central court is facilitated through a narrow passage in the centre from the east, as well as a flight of steps connecting it to the eastern doorway of the Mukhamandapam. The interior columns are sculpted into the forms of rearing yalis and have Vijayanagara style brackets, while outer pillars are adorned with deity figures, decorative motifs, animal figures, etc.
